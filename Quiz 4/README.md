Diagonal Difference:

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of my solution is O(n) since the single for loop is looped through as many times as the input size (size of the given array). All things inside and outside the loop have time complexity of O(1), so the final time complexity is O(n).

Space Complexity:
The space complexity of my solution is O(1) since only a constant (fixed no matter the input size) amount of extra space other than the initial input is used.
