Time Complexity: As stated in the code, the time complexity of my plusMinus solution is O(n). This is because there is one for loop that iterates from 0 to the size of the array with constant work inside and outside the loop.
Space Complexity: As stated in the code, the space complexity of my plusMinus solution is O(1). This is because only constant space is used other than the space to store the input.
